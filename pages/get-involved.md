# Get Involved
HARMONY連 thrives on collaboration. There are multiple ways to contribute—choose your role and reach out via [Contact Us](/contact-us) to start your journey with us.

---

## Become a Debater
Open to anyone passionate about research and innovation.  
Debaters can read, discuss, and submit theses by generating a keypair using [**所ID**](https://github.com/kai5041/shoid).  

Contribute your ideas, engage in debates, and help shape the collective’s knowledge base—without legal obligations.

---

## Become an Operator
Operators are official, income-generating members of HARMONY連, empowered to take on legal responsibilities.  
Joining requires a legally binding agreement signed with an **eIDAS-compliant electronic signature**, as all members act as independent contractors.  

If you’re ready to step into a formal role, contact {{ kai_placeholder }} via [**Contact Us**](/contact-us).  

> **Note:** Currently, only residents of Italy can become legally contracted members. International expansion is planned with support from [**所ID**](https://github.com/kai5041/shoid).

---

## Become a Proxy
Represent your organization within HARMONY連.  
Proxies may either assign one of your staff or delegate a HARMONY連 member to act on your behalf.  

Proxies enjoy the same rights and responsibilities as **Operators**, enabling your organization to actively participate in initiatives and contribute to collective innovation.
