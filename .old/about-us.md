# About Us

**HARMONY連** (pronounced "**HARMONY REN**") is an **Open Innovation Collective** founded in **Italy**, dedicated to **research**, **discussion**, and **innovation**.

## How the Collective Works
HARMONY連 organizes its members into three roles:

- **Debater** – Open to all. Can read, write, submit, and review theses. Contributes to discussions and development but holds no legal or financial responsibilities.  
- **Operator** – A legally recognized role. Can do everything a **Debater** can, **plus** assume legal responsibilities and earn income within the collective.  
- **Proxy** – Represents an external legal entity collaborating with HARMONY連.

For details on joining, see [Get Involved](/get-involved).

## Purpose of Theses
Theses are structured documents designed to present ideas clearly and rationally. Each thesis should include:

1. **Proposal** – A concise statement of the idea.  
2. **Antithesis** – Potential objections, counterarguments, or alternative perspectives.  
3. **Rationale** – Why the proposal matters and its potential impact.  
4. **Implementation Overview** – A high-level plan; detailed elaborations can follow in later work.

All theses must be **cryptographically signed** using [所ID](https://github.com/kai5041/shoid).  
> **Note:** The signature must be submitted as a separate binary file.

For collaborative theses:

- List all contributors under **Authors**, including their IDs.  
- Include each contributor’s cryptographic signature and key ID when submitting the thesis.

To streamline submissions, we recommend using our [proposal template](/files/proposal_template.odt).
